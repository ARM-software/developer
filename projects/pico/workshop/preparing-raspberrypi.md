# How to prepare Raspberry Pi

Follow the below steps:

- Flash Raspbian OS on SD card

If you are in Mac, you might need to install Etcher tool. If on Windows, install SDFormatter to format SD card as well as Win32installer to flash Raspbian ISO image onto the SD card. You will need SD card reader to achieve this.


## Booting up Raspbian OS

Just use the same charger which you use for your mobile to power on Raspberry Pi box. Connect HDMI port to your TV or display. Let it boot up.


The default username is pi and password is raspberry.


### Enable SSH to perform remote login

To login via your laptop, you need to allow SSH service running. You can verify IP address command via ifconfig command.

```
