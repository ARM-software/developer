# RTMP + Nginx for Video Streaming using Docker on Jetson Nano

- Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is an open source protocol owned by Adobe thatâ€™s designed to stream audio and video by maintaining low latency connections.
- It is a TCP-based protocol designed to maintain low-latency connections for audio and video streaming. 
- It is a protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.
- To increase the amount of data that can be smoothly transmitted, streams are split into smaller fragments called packets. 
- RTMP also defines several virtual channels that work independently of each other for packets to be delivered on. 
- This means that video and audio are delivered on separate channels simultaneously.
- Clients use a handshake to form a connection with an RTMP server which then allows users to stream video and audio.
- RTMP live streaming generally requires a media server and a content delivery network, but by leveraging StackPath EdgeCompute you can remove the need for a CDN and drastically reduce latency and costs.

## Setup:

- Attach Raspberry Pi with Camera Module
- Turn Your Raspberry Pi into CCTV Camera
- Run RTMP + Nginx inside Docker container on Jetson Nano
- Run Yolo inside Docker container on Jetson Nano

## How to run RTMP inside Docker Container on Jetson Nano

```
docker run -d -p 1935:1935 --name nginx-rtmp ajeetraina/nginx-rtmp-arm:latest
```

If you want to build the Docker Image from Dockerfile, follow the below steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/collabnix/pico
cd pico/rtmp/
docker build -t ajeetraina/nginx-rtmp-arm .
```

## Testing RTMP with OBS Studio and VLC

This can be tested either on your laptop or Raspberry Pi(omxplayer).

Follow the below steps in case you have Windows Laptop with OBS Studo and VLC installed.

- Open OBS Studio
- Click the "Settings" button
- Go to the "Stream" section
- In "Stream Type" select "Custom Streaming Server"
- In the "URL" enter the rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live replacing <ip_of_host> with the IP of the host in which the container is running. For example: rtmp://192.168.0.30/live
- In the "Stream key" use a "key" that will be used later in the client URL to display that specific stream. For example: test
- Click the "OK" button
- In the section "Sources" click de "Add" button (+) and select a source (for example "Screen Capture") and configure it as you need
- Click the "Start Streaming" button
- Open a VLC player (it also works in Raspberry Pi using omxplayer)
- Click in the "Media" menu
- Click in "Open Network Stream"
- Enter the URL from above as rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live/<key> replacing <ip_of_host> with the IP of the host in which the container is running and <key> with the key you created in OBS Studio. For example: rtmp://192.168.0.30/live/test
- Click "Play"
- Now VLC should start playing whatever you are transmitting from OBS Studio
