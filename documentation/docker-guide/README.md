# Docker Guide for Arm developers

Docker containers are everywhere, primarily because they run the same everywhere. Containers are used on all major operating systems, on all major computing architectures to build, share, and run software. 
As more and more of the worldâ€™s computing happens on the Arm architecture, developers are looking for resources to make container development and deployment as easy as possible. 

We hope you find these ideas helpful.
